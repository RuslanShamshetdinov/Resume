# Bringing grammar to the normal form of Chomsky
A program that reduces a grammar to Chomsky's normal form and performs the following functions:   
1. Organizing the input of the grammar and checking that it belongs to the class of 
context free grammars; 
2. Checking the existence of the language of the context-free grammar;
3. Implementation of equivalent transformations of the grammar aimed at removing: 
    - Non-reducible characters; 
    - Unreachable characters; 
    - Mixed chains; 
    - Long chains; 
    - E-rules;
